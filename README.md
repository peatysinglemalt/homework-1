```

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## refactoring work completed to meet accessiibility standards without affecting the website 

```
- added a descriptive title 
- provided accessible alt attribute tags  
- replaced non-semantic HTML with semantic HTML elements with logical structure 
- consolidated redundant CSS elements 
- added missing links, and alt tags to images
```
